# joyfork
Github fork service for Healthjoy coding assessment. 


GOAL ==================================================

Write a web service which provides an endpoint that a user can trigger from within a web browser.
Endpoint should respond only to safe HTTP methods. (i.e., POST/PUT/PATCH)
Please explain your decision of choosing a HTTP method.
By triggering the endpoint service, a user can fork it's own Github repo to the userâ€™s account.


Solution ==============================================

Will use PUT. Idempotent in nature. Eg, we can call many times, if it times out, no problem. Just call again.
Note: Github API docs specify using POST to create a fork. https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/forks/
However after testing, there are no additional side-effects when called multiple times. 
While it is possible the Github API may change at any time and doesn't guarantee idempotent behavior for forking, 
I feel PUT more accurately reflects the current nature of the service. 

Also note, Idempotent is not the same as safe. A safe method has no side-effects. This service however, most certainly has a side-effect (forking a repo). 

Update: Of course. The PUT method isn't support by HTML the form method attribute. 
Ultimately the code could use Javascript to submit the form with PUT using XMLHttpRequest, but for the sake of simplicity and time, I'll leave this as an exercise to the viewer. :D

Deploy Instructions ====================================

Code requires the following environment variables to be defined:
FLASK_SECRET, GITHUB_CLIENT_ID, and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET (instructions below, don't worry)
Refer to fork.py for more details on their usage.
Deployment is otherwise straightforward.

Heroku Deployment:
Below are instruction for deploying to a free tier Heroku account.

0) Checkout this code to your local machine if you haven't done so already

1) Create a new app at Heroku

2) Register your new app for Github oauth
Here: https://github.com/settings/applications/new

  Use following
  homepage: https://APPNAME.herokuapp.com/
  callback: https://APPNAME.herokuapp.com/login/github/authorized

  For local testing use:
  callback: http://127.0.0.1:5000/login/github/authorized

Where APPNAME refers to the name of the Heroku app in step #1.
Save the client_id, and client_secret for step #5.

3) Install Heroku CLI
Instructions here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

4) Initialize Heroku CLI
$ heroku login

5) Set Heroku config vars
Using the oauth registration from step #2, along with the Heroku app name from step #1:
$ heroku config:set FLASK_SECRET=anything_you_want GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx -app your_heroku_appname

For local testing, don't forget to set environment variables locally!
Oh yes, and you must add this tricky variable as well for local testing (without https): 
$ export OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=true

6) Push code to Heroku
$ git push heroku master
